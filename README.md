- SSH (Secure Shell)
- Web Server Enviroment - NGINX, Apache
- App Hosting - Linode, Heroku, AWS, Azure, Now
- Virtualization - Docker, Vagrant
- Testing - Unit, Functional, Integration, etc
- Load Balancing, Monitoring, Security, etc

Your Skill
> Full Stack Dev

You are now a fullstack rockstar that can create and deploy powerful, database driven web apps
- Build user interfaces using whatever front-end technologies you choose
- Fluent in a server-side language and framework
- Setup dev enviroemnts and workflows
- Build backend apps, APIs, microservices
- Work with databases, SQL, ORMs
- Deploy to production (SSH, Git, Cloud, etc)

The Mobile Experience
> Mobile Development (Choose One)

We have some really cool technologies to build native mobile apps with web technologies
- Flutter - SDK from Google to build native mobile apps. Uses Dart
- React Native - Build native mobile apps using the React framework
- NativeScript - Build native mobile apps with JS, TS, Angular or Vue
- Ionic - Build hybrid mobile apps with JavaScript
- Xamarin - Build native mobile apps with C#

> PWA: Progressive Web apps

PWAs are regular web apps (HTML/CSS/JS) but have a native feel as far as experience, layout and functionality
- Look great on all screen sizes
- Offline content with service workers
- Installable
- Splash screen
- Must be HTTPS
- Reliable, fast and engaging

The Desktop Experience
> Desktop Apps With Electron

Electron allows us to cross-platform desktop applications with JavaScript
- Uses Node.js & Chromium
- High Data Security
- High Performance
- Accessibility
- Examples: VSCode, Atom, Postman, Discord

New Trends
> JAMstack

"JavaScript, APIs & Markup" is a modern web developemnt architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuild Markup

- No restriction on framework or library
- Websites are served as static html files generated from source files, such as markdown using a static site generator like Gatsby
- High Performance, generated at deploy time
- Cheaper and easy to scale
- Easy to host (Netify)

> Serverless architecture

Server operations without actually needing your own server
- "Backend" or "Functions" as a service (FaaS)
- Reduce complexity and costs
- Less infrastructure to manage
- AWS Lambda & Netify

> API-First Design

With more and more IoT (Internet of Things) expect to see api-focused Design
- Traditional we start with the UI and then move to the backend with a strict connection to the web app 
- With API-first design, you start with the appropriate APIs and then build productions on top of it 

> Machine Learning / AI & The Web

Machine learning & AI are growing in all areas of technology and can be useful in web apps/services
- Alternative to conventional data mining
- Remove security threats
- Machine learning APIs
- Producing content
- Study user behavior
- Much more...

> Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is a major trend in technology. In 2020, expect to see more of this in web apps, especially with search
- HTML5 Web Speech API
- Google Speech-To-Text
- Dialog Flow
